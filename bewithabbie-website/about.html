<h2>Breathwork & Somatics</h2>
<p>Breathwork and somatics sound new, but the practices are as old as the hills. Throughout history we have found ways to calm our nervous system by chanting, deep breathing, connecting with nature, and thus connecting to ourselves. 
    Recently, many of us have forgotten these practices, and we may have met ourselves at a moment when we need them most.
    At Be With Abbie, I encourage you to take a moment to yourself to do just that - Be. When you give yourself that opportunity, we practice self-care in the truest sense of the term: doing something for yourself so that you can be more present for the people around you.
    This is very much an embodied practice. We won't be sitting in silence and waiting for calm, we create calm by moving, making noise and breathing deeply. It's after you connect with yourself in this way that the peace and inspiration comes.
    Treat yourself to a group session on a Sunday morning in the cosy surroundings of The Calm Rooms in Monkstown, gift yourself a new experience, and see what magic awaits! 
    If you are interested in a private or one-to-one session, please let me know via email at hello@bewithabbie.ie.

    I trained under Anne Marie Kramer of Wild Soul Breathwork & Somatics and am certified as a Breathwork & Somatics Facilitator.
