<h2>Breathwork & Somatics</h2>
<p> You may have guessed my name is Abbie! I am a certified Breathwork & Somatics Facilitator. I would love for you to take some time to just ~ be ~ with me.
    <br> </br>
    Throughout history and across cultures, humans have developed incredibly intelligent ways to bring ourselves into calm. 
    <br> </br>
    In recent decades, we have learned how these practices work physiologically, and that is by bringing our nervous system into rest through techniques that allow the body to discharge stored stress,
    stimulate the vagus nerve, allow ourselves to sink deeply into our body and to give our bodies a reset in order to feel centred and grounded.
<br> </br>
    While we now have the scientific understanding of how these techniques work, very few of us are implementing these practices into our lives, and with increasing stressors and fewer outlets that encourage internal connection or development of community, I believe we may be more in need of these practices now than we ever have before.
    <br> </br>
    This is very much an embodied practice. We won't be sitting in silence and waiting for calm, we create calm by moving, making noise and breathing deeply. It's after you connect with yourself in this way that the peace and inspiration comes.
    <br>
</br>
    Treat yourself to a group session on a Sunday morning in the cosy surroundings of The Calm Rooms in Monkstown. Gift yourself a new experience, and see what magic awaits! 
    <br>
</br>
    This is not just for yogis and experienced meditators, this practice is an accessible method to get you out of your chattering mind and into your body.
    <br>
</br>
     This is a trauma informed practice, together we create a space that feels safe to connect with ourselves deeply, and leave feeling grounded.
<br>
</br>
      If you are interested in a private or one-to-one session, please contact me via email at hello@bewithabbie.ie.

   I trained under Anne Marie Kramer of Wild Soul Breathwork & Somatics.
