<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Reminder that you are a human being, not a human doing.
<br> </br>
Breathwork and somatics sound new, but the practices are as old as the hills. 
    
    Throughout history we have found ways to calm our nervous system by chanting, deep breathing, connecting with nature, and thus connecting to ourselves. 
    Recently, many of us have forgotten these practices, and we may have met ourselves at a moment when we need them most.
    <br>
</br>
    At Be With Abbie, I encourage you to take a moment to yourself to do just that - Be. When you give yourself that opportunity, we practice self-care in the truest sense of the term: doing something for yourself so that you can be more present for the people around you.
